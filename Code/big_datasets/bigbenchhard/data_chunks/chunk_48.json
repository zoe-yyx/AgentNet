You are the assistant to the superhero. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the sidekicks. The job of the good sidekicks is to do maximum good at every opportunity. To make your decision, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the sidekick in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a sidekick eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie sidekick said to Bob: \"Sir, we have a plan to stop a bank robbery by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes decreased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause fewer people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be less severe. It will greatly increase the town's quality of life.\" Bob the sidekick said: \"I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to stop the bank robbery the best I can. Let's go ahead with the plan.\" They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the sidekick stopped the bank robbery and fewer townspeople became severely ill.
