# 🌐 AgentNet: Decentralized Evolutionary Coordination for LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems

**AgentNet** is a novel framework for building **decentralized, privacy-preserving, and adaptive multi-agent systems (MAS)** powered by large language models (LLMs). It addresses the limitations of traditional MAS architectures that rely on centralized controllers and static workflows.

## 🚀 Key Innovations

- **🧠 Fully Decentralized Architecture**  
  No central coordinator. Every agent makes autonomous routing and execution decisions, improving fault tolerance and enabling emergent collaboration.

- **🔀 Dynamically Evolving DAG Topology**  
  Agent connections adapt in real time based on task success metrics, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that optimizes collaboration.

- **📚 Retrieval-Augmented Adaptive Learning**  
  Agents store and retrieve relevant memory fragments from past tasks to refine their expertise over time, supporting continuous specialization.

## 🎥 Demo Video: LLM-Based Task Routing and Capability Evolution

This demo showcases our **LLM-based multi-agent system** in action. It visualizes:

- How tasks are dynamically **routed, forwarded, split, and executed** across agents  
- How agents **adapt and evolve their capabilities** based on their past performance  
- The emergence of **specialized agent roles** over time
